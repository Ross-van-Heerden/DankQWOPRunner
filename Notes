Sup Breh! Nice to see you again.

Some notes on what I was trying / playing with.

Question on object orientation in Python:
Instead of having 'class Individual' inside the Individual.py file should we just remove it?
Feels weird having to say Individual.Individual() when we wna construct a new Individual, but dno how the proper way
of doing this is.

Where I am atm:
Have to make the Population class do crossover properly now. Gna be tough.
If I'm not keen for that I could work on integrating Stephans screen shot code with the running of an Individual in
Master, i.e. Continue running till keypress sequence is done or guy dies, and then get the fitness from the screen shot.
